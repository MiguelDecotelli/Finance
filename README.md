# My Shares

## QUOTE

## BUY
- Allows you to buy as much shares you can afford by selecting it's symbol and the amount.

## SELL
- Allows you to sell any of your shares portfolio by the current price, not the one you bought them.

## HISTORY
- Check out if you made good transactions on your history, which shows your acquisitons and sells all on the same place!

## STOCK'S LIST
- Here you can look for a company's name and check it's symbol to quote or buy later on. Or you can just See all 5 plus thousands shares at once! 

## ADD CASH
- Felling a bit short? You add more (virtual) extra money if you spent more than you was willing to (Don't tell the wife!). It will only accept a valid card number (not expecting that you type a real one, but no dummies allowed).

## CHANGE PASSWORD
- Always good to have an option to change your password. But in this case, you won't be receiving a link to reset it. at least not for now.
